Feature: RetrieveLocationData
  As a consumer of the Zippopotam.us API
  I want to recieve location data matching the country code and zip code I supply 
  So I can use this data to auto-complete forms on my website

  Scenario: An existing country and zip code yields the correct place name 
   Given the country code us and zip code 90210
   When I request the locations corresponding to these codes 
   Then the response contains the place name Beverly Hills

  Scenario: An existing country and zip code yields the right number of results 
   Given the country code us and zip code 90210
   When I request the locations corresponding to these codes
   Then the response contains exactly 1 locaton
